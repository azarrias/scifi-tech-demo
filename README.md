# Sci-Fi Tech Demo

Sci-Fi Tech Demo is an FPS-type demo that I used to experiment with lights, reflection probes, destructibles, etc. on a 3D setting.
You can move around and explore the market, collect a coin from the vending machine, buy a weapon with that coin and shoot and destroy the wooden crate.
When the weapon is out of ammunition, you can reload by pressing R.

* WebGL build playable [here](https://www.adolfozarrias.com/scifi-tech-demo/).
